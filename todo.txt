Board
  getCells()
    cache at construction time
    Use it in getCandidateLocations() with a .filter() call

Cell
  Cell.text needs unifying
  Cell click handlers should both go to the cell first, not the parent first
    Cell.handleFlag should ONLY handle updating the UI
    button.oncontextmenu should call parent.flag(), which then calls the Cell

  createMineCellElements needs comments
    Sort it, put all the button stuff together, all text stuff together, etc.

  We need Board.onClick and Board.onContextMenu to be the event handlers, pass x,y
    Interact with the Board only through Board methods
    Control always flows User/UI --> Board --> Cell

  toggleFlag
    ! spacing
    hasFlagsRemaining should just be getFlagCount()

  ALL the UI changes code belongs in an updateUi(), which just reads the private vars

  Scap Cell.revealed?

  Figure out which methods can be private, and make them private

  Rename cell.neighbors --> cell.neighboringMines to indicate it means mines

    Second order inferences
      Example:
        F 3 1
        ? ? ?
      From the 1, we know that exactly one of (1, 1) or (2, 1) contains a mine.
      From the 3, we know that exactly two of (0, 1), (1, 1) and (2, 1) contain mines.
      Combining these facts, we can infer that (0, 1) must be a mine.

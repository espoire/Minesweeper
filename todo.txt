Cell
  Cell.text needs unifying
  Cell click handlers should both go to the cell first, not the parent first
    Cell.handleFlag should ONLY handle updating the UI
    button.oncontextmenu should call parent.flag(), which then calls the Cell

  ALL the UI changes code belongs in an updateUi(), which just reads the private vars

  Scap Cell.revealed?

  Figure out which methods can be private, and make them private

  Rename cell.neighbors --> cell.neighboringMines to indicate it means mines
